This file demonstrates the DRB Logfile Rounding Program.

The input file can be free-format. All numbers are rounded to four significant places.

For example, there are not 365 days in most years, but 366 days in a
leap year. On average, there are 365.25 days in a year.  Likewise,
there are 31,536,000 seconds in a normal year, but 31,622,400 seconds
in a leap year.

The Logfile Rounding Program is written in Python 3.6. To use it to
round the file input.log, try this command:

   $ python3 drb_rounder input.log
   Output in input_rounded.log
   Pre-rounded text in input_0.html
   Rounded text in input_1.html



one year, there are actually
365.25 (365 and a quarter) days in a year.
